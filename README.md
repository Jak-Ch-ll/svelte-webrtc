# Svelte + WebRTC

This app is a basic playing ground to learn about WebRTC. I used the following three videos as a starting ground:

- [WebRTC Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FExZvpVvYxA) by Hussein Nasser
- [WebRTC in 100 Seconds // Build a Video Chat app from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmR9IMUD_CY) by Fireship
- [How To Create A Video Chat App With WebRTC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvlyzDZDEq4) by Web Dev Simplified

My Goal was to create a minimal video chat app with the native WebRTC API and my own signaling server. Non of the tutorials offered exactly that but by combining the knowledge I was able to cobble together this application.

This app is only supposed to serve for experimentation, is currently absolutly unstructred and should by now means be used for anything in the real world.

## To run the server

1. cd into the /server directory
2. run `pnpm install`
3. run `pnpm dev`

## To run the client

1. run `pnpm install`
2. run `pnpm dev`
